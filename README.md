# Xiaomi-HyperOS-Turkish-Language-Project

This is a Magisk module to add translation to the Chinese version of MIUI and Xiaomi HyperOS roms.  
This module also enables Google Location history and Nearby share.

Download HyperOSTRTranslation.zip, install this module from the Modules tab of the Magisk app and restart, then you will be able to select your language in the language settings.

I tested on Xiaomi HyperOS Rom.
